A PHP toolkit for Colombian DIAN electronic invoicing: UBL 2.1 document generation, XAdES-EPES digital signing, CUFE/CUDE/CUDS/CUNE computation, and a SOAP client for DIAN's `WcfDianCustomerServices` web services.

`cofacture` is a **library, not a platform** — no database, no HTTP framework dependency, no opinion about how you store your data. You feed it plain PHP objects; it hands back signed XML, ready to package and submit. You own the pipeline (build → hash → sign → zip → send): nothing here retries on your behalf, persists a consecutive number, or validates a catalog code before putting it where the technical annex says it goes.

---

## Features

- **Full document coverage** — Electronic Sales Invoice, Credit Note, Debit Note, Support Document, Adjustment Note to the Support Document, Attached Document, the five RADIAN acceptance/rejection events, and Individual Electronic Payroll.
- **XAdES-EPES signing** — inclusive C14N 1.0 canonicalization, RSA-SHA256, DIAN's fixed signature policy, built from PEM or PKCS#12 (`.p12`/`.pfx`) certificates.
- **Hash formulas verified against DIAN's own published worked examples** (Technical Annex 1.9), not just internal regression tests — CUFE, CUDE, CUDS, and the RADIAN event CUDE each have a dedicated test reproducing DIAN's official example.
- **SOAP 1.2 + WS-Security client** implementing 16 operations of the `WcfDianCustomerServices` contract: `sendBillSync`, `sendBillAsync`, `sendBillAttachmentAsync`, `sendTestSetAsync`, `getStatus`, `getStatusZip`, `getNumberingRange`, `sendNominaSync`, `sendNominaSyncTestSet`, `sendEventUpdateStatus`, `getStatusEvent`, `getAcquirer`, `getXmlByDocumentKey`, `getReferenceNotes`, `getDocumentInfo`, `getExchangeEmails`.
- **Response interpretation** — DIAN's validation messages are parsed into structured rejections vs. informational notices, ready to branch on.
- **Namespace-correct XML by construction** — every element is created through a single namespace-aware factory, avoiding a common PHP DOM pitfall where a manually-prefixed element silently breaks canonicalization and produces an invalid digest.

## Installation

```bash
composer require diegofxm/cofacture
```

Requires PHP 8.1+ with the `dom`, `openssl`, and `zip` extensions.

---

## Quick start

Building, signing, and submitting a single invoice, end to end. Error handling is abbreviated for readability — check every error in real code.

```php
<?php

use Cofacture\Builder\InvoiceBuilder;
use Cofacture\Builder\SignaturePlaceholder;
use Cofacture\Cufe\Cufe;
use Cofacture\Dian\Result;
use Cofacture\Domain\Bogota;
use Cofacture\Domain\DocumentType;
use Cofacture\Domain\Environment;
use Cofacture\Domain\Invoice;
use Cofacture\Domain\NumberingRange;
use Cofacture\Qr\Qr;
use Cofacture\SecurityCode\SecurityCode;
use Cofacture\Signer\CertificateLoader;
use Cofacture\Signer\Signer;
use Cofacture\Soap\Client;
use Cofacture\Zip\Zip;

// 1. Load your DIAN-issued certificate (.p12) once, reuse it across documents — for both
//    XAdES document signing and the SOAP WS-Security header.
$credentials = CertificateLoader::loadPkcs12(file_get_contents('software.p12'), 'your-p12-password');

// 2. Query the numbering range DIAN authorized for your issuer + software pair (cache the
//    result — it doesn't change per document). technicalKey feeds Cufe::compute() below.
$soap = new Client(Client::HABILITACION_URL, $credentials);
$ranges = $soap->getNumberingRange('900123456', '900123456', $softwareUuid);
$range = $ranges->responseList[0];

// 3. Build the domain model. Everything here comes from your own system (ERP, database,
//    order service, etc.) — cofacture never fetches it for you. $supplier, $customer,
//    $headerTaxes, $totals, and $lines below are placeholders for values you supply.
$invoice = new Invoice(
    profileId: 'DIAN 2.1: Factura Electrónica de Venta',
    environmentCode: Environment::Habilitacion, // Environment::Produccion once certified
    operationTypeCode: '10',
    documentTypeCode: DocumentType::Invoice,
    hashType: 'CUFE-SHA384',
    prefix: $range->prefix,
    number: '990000001',
    issueDate: date('Y-m-d'),
    issueTime: date('H:i:sP'),
    currencyCode: 'COP',
    supplier: $supplier,
    customer: $customer,
    headerTaxes: $headerTaxes,
    totals: $totals,
    lines: $lines,
    numberingRange: new NumberingRange(
        authorizedCode: $range->resolutionNumber,
        prefix: $range->prefix,
        startNumber: (string) $range->fromNumber,
        endNumber: (string) $range->toNumber,
        startDate: $range->validDateFrom,
        endDate: $range->validDateTo,
    ),
    softwareProvider: $softwareProvider,
);

// 4. Compute the identifiers DIAN requires before the document can be signed.
//    $softwareId/$pin are the credentials DIAN assigned when you activated your software.
$invoice->cufe = Cufe::compute($invoice, $range->technicalKey);
$invoice->softwareSecurityCode = SecurityCode::compute($softwareId, $pin, $invoice->prefix . $invoice->number);
$invoice->qrUrl = Qr::url($invoice->environmentCode, $invoice->cufe);

// 5. Build the UBL XML tree and sign it (XAdES-EPES).
$doc = InvoiceBuilder::build($invoice);
$placeholder = SignaturePlaceholder::find($doc);
(new Signer($credentials))->sign($doc->documentElement, $placeholder, 'supplier', new DateTimeImmutable('now', Bogota::timezone()));
$xml = $doc->saveXML();

// 6. Name and package the file the way DIAN's receiving service expects.
$fileName = Zip::documentFileName(Zip::KIND_INVOICE, '900123456', Zip::SOFTWARE_PROPIO_CODE, (int) date('Y'), 1);
$zipBytes = Zip::build([$fileName => $xml]);

// 7. Send it to DIAN and interpret the response.
$result = Result::interpret($soap->sendBillSync($fileName, $zipBytes));
if (!$result->isValid) {
    throw new RuntimeException('DIAN rejected the invoice: ' . implode('; ', array_map(fn ($m) => $m->raw, $result->messages)));
}
echo "Accepted: {$result->statusDescription}\n";
```

Every other document type follows the same shape — build the domain model, compute its hash (`Cude\Cude`, `Cuds\Cuds`, `Event\Event`, or `Payroll\Cune` in place of `Cufe\Cufe`), build the XML tree with the matching builder, sign, package, and send. See [Document coverage](#document-coverage) below for the full list and [Package map](#package-map) for where each piece lives.

## Document coverage

| Document | Type code(s) | DIAN certification status |
|---|---|---|
| Electronic Sales Invoice | `01` | Confirmed accepted in DIAN's certification (habilitación) environment |
| Credit Note | `91` | Hash formula matches DIAN's official worked example |
| Debit Note | `92` | Hash formula matches DIAN's official worked example |
| Support Document | `05` | Built and independently signature-verified; not yet submitted |
| Adjustment Note to the Support Document | `95` | Built and independently signature-verified; not yet submitted |
| Attached Document (container for Invoice/Credit Note/Debit Note) | — | Built and independently signature-verified; delivered to the acquirer, not submitted to DIAN by design |
| RADIAN events — Acuse de Recibo, Reclamo, Recibo del Bien, Aceptación Expresa, Aceptación Tácita | `030`–`034` | Built per the technical annex's field tables; not yet submitted |
| Individual Electronic Payroll & Adjustment | `102`/`103`/`104` | Built and independently signature-verified; not yet submitted |
| Documento Equivalente Electrónico (POS ticket, etc.) | `20`, `25`, ... | Supported via the Invoice/Credit Note/Debit Note builders with the applicable type code |

### Design boundaries (not gaps)

- **No catalog/reference-data validation** — tax types, unit codes, city/DANE codes, payment methods, etc. `cofacture` trusts the caller and only knows where a code goes in the XML, not whether it's valid.
- **No graphic representation (RIDE/PDF) generator.** DIAN doesn't validate this over SOAP; it's outside this library's scope.
- **No orchestration layer.** No single "send a document" call — you own numbering, idempotency, retry logic, and persisting consecutive numbers.

## Package map

| Namespace | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `Cofacture\Domain` | Plain PHP objects for every document (`Invoice`, `CreditNote`, `DebitNote`, `AdjustmentNote`, `AttachedDocument`, `Event`, `Reclamo`, `Party`, `Tax`, `Line`, ...). No validation, no persistence. |
| `Cofacture\Xml` | Shared UBL/DIAN namespace constants and the namespace-aware XML element factory every builder uses. |
| `Cofacture\Builder` | Assembles the UBL 2.1 + DIAN-extension XML tree from a domain model — every document type, including the RADIAN `ApplicationResponse` events. Does not sign, hash, or send anything. |
| `Cofacture\Cufe` | Computes the CUFE for the Electronic Sales Invoice. |
| `Cofacture\Cude` | Computes the CUDE for Credit Notes, Debit Notes, and Documento Equivalente Electrónico. |
| `Cofacture\Cuds` | Computes the CUDS for the Support Document and its Adjustment Note. |
| `Cofacture\Event` | Computes the CUDE for RADIAN events and holds their response-code catalog. |
| `Cofacture\Payroll` | Builds `NominaIndividual` XML (a distinct, non-UBL schema) and computes the CUNE. |
| `Cofacture\SecurityCode` | Computes `sts:SoftwareSecurityCode`. |
| `Cofacture\Qr` | Builds the QR URL/content required in each document type's graphic representation. |
| `Cofacture\Signer` | XAdES-EPES signing plus certificate/key loading (PEM and PKCS#12). |
| `Cofacture\Zip` | Packages signed XML into the ZIP format and file-naming convention DIAN's receiving service requires. |
| `Cofacture\Soap` | SOAP 1.2 + WS-Security client for `WcfDianCustomerServices` (habilitación and producción). |
| `Cofacture\Dian` | Interprets DIAN's validation responses into a structured result (rejections vs. notices, embedded `ApplicationResponse`, etc.). |

## Security notes

- **Never commit certificates, `.p12`/`.pfx` files, PINs, or software IDs.** Review `git status` before every commit.
- `Signer\CertificateLoader` loads key material into memory only — this library never persists it anywhere.
- `SecurityCode::compute()` takes your DIAN-assigned software ID/PIN directly; treat both as secrets with the same care as a private key.
- Tests that talk to DIAN's real certification server require a real certificate and credentials that are never part of this package.

---

## Testing

```bash
composer install
vendor/bin/phpunit
```

Runs the full unit suite — hash golden vectors (several cross-checked against DIAN's own published worked examples), full build → sign → verify → package pipelines for every document type, WS-Security envelope self-verification, and SOAP response parsing — with no network access and no credentials required. Every test that needs a certificate generates its own throwaway self-signed one.

## Disclaimer

This project is an independent, community-built toolkit. It is **not affiliated with, endorsed by, or officially certified by DIAN** (*Dirección de Impuestos y Aduanas Nacionales*). Achieving DIAN's *habilitación* (certification) for a specific NIT/software combination is a separate process the taxpayer/technology provider must complete directly with DIAN; this library helps you build the documents involved, but using it correctly does not by itself grant certification. See [Document coverage](#document-coverage) for exactly which document types have been confirmed against a real DIAN server before relying on this library in production.
